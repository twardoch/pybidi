# PyBidi Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

PyBidi is a Python 3 binding for the FriBidi library, providing Unicode bidirectional text algorithm support. The project appears to be in maintenance mode, with a note indicating it has moved to other repositories. However, there are significant opportunities to modernize and improve the codebase.

## Key Areas for Improvement

### 1. Modern Python Packaging and Build System

#### Current Issues:
- Using legacy setup.py with minimal configuration
- No pyproject.toml file (PEP 517/518 compliance)
- No proper dependency management
- Version is hardcoded in setup.py

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Migrate to pyproject.toml with proper build system configuration
- Use setuptools with declarative configuration
- Implement proper version management (possibly using setuptools_scm)
- Add proper metadata including long description, classifiers, and URLs
- Consider using Poetry or Hatch for modern dependency management

### 2. Type Safety and Modern Python Features

#### Current Issues:
- No type annotations throughout the codebase
- Using old-style string formatting
- No use of modern Python features (dataclasses, enums, etc.)
- Manual memory management with ctypes without proper safety checks

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Add comprehensive type hints using typing module
- Create type stubs (.pyi files) for better IDE support
- Use Enum for constants instead of class attributes
- Implement proper error types instead of generic RuntimeError
- Add mypy configuration for static type checking
- Use dataclasses for structured data where appropriate

### 3. Error Handling and Library Loading

#### Current Issues:
- Basic platform detection for library loading
- No fallback mechanisms if library is not found
- No clear error messages for missing dependencies
- Limited error handling in ctypes calls

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Implement robust library detection with multiple search paths
- Add clear installation instructions for each platform
- Create a compatibility layer that handles different FriBidi versions
- Add proper exception hierarchy with informative error messages
- Implement retry mechanisms and fallbacks where appropriate

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

#### Current Issues:
- No test suite exists
- No continuous integration setup
- No code coverage metrics
- No performance benchmarks

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Create comprehensive test suite using pytest
- Add unit tests for all public APIs
- Implement integration tests with actual FriBidi library
- Add property-based testing using Hypothesis
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Configure code coverage with codecov
- Add performance benchmarks for critical operations

### 5. Documentation

#### Current Issues:
- Minimal README file
- No API documentation
- No usage examples
- No contribution guidelines

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Create comprehensive README with badges, installation, and usage
- Add Sphinx-based documentation
- Generate API documentation from docstrings
- Create tutorial notebooks with Jupyter
- Add examples directory with common use cases
- Write contribution guidelines and code of conduct

### 6. Code Quality and Maintainability

#### Current Issues:
- Large monolithic fribidi.py file (1500+ lines)
- Mixed concerns (low-level bindings with high-level API)
- Inconsistent coding style
- No linting or formatting configuration

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Split code into logical modules:
  - `core.py`: Core ctypes bindings
  - `constants.py`: FriBidi constants and enums
  - `types.py`: Type definitions and data structures
  - `api.py`: High-level Python API
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions
- Configure black for code formatting
- Set up flake8/ruff for linting
- Add pre-commit hooks for consistency
- Implement proper logging instead of print statements

### 7. Platform Support and Distribution

#### Current Issues:
- Manual platform detection
- No wheel distribution
- No conda package
- Unclear system requirements

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Create platform-specific wheels
- Add conda-forge recipe
- Support more platforms (including ARM architectures)
- Create Docker images for testing
- Add clear system requirements documentation
- Consider bundling FriBidi library or using cibuildwheel

### 8. API Improvements

#### Current Issues:
- Low-level API requires understanding of FriBidi internals
- No convenient high-level functions for common tasks
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- No async support where beneficial

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Create high-level API wrapper with intuitive methods
- Add convenience functions for common operations
- Implement context managers where appropriate
- Add builder pattern for complex operations
- Consider async support for batch processing

### 9. Security and Safety

#### Current Issues:
- Direct ctypes usage without bounds checking
- Potential buffer overflows in string handling
- No input validation

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Implement safe string handling with proper bounds checking
- Add security policy documentation
- Regular dependency updates
- Consider using CFFI instead of ctypes for better safety

### 10. Community and Maintenance

#### Current Issues:
- Project marked as moved to other repositories
- Unclear maintenance status
- No community engagement

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Clarify project status and future direction
- Set up GitHub Discussions for community engagement
- Create issue templates for bugs and features
- Establish clear governance model
- Consider moving to a community organization
- Set up GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective for funding

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Essential for modernization):
   - Modern packaging (pyproject.toml)
   - Basic test suite
   - Type annotations
   - Improved error handling

2. **Medium Priority** (Significant improvements):
   - Code refactoring into modules
   - Documentation
   - CI/CD setup
   - Platform wheels

3. **Low Priority** (Nice to have):
   - Advanced API features
   - Performance optimizations
   - Additional platform support
   - Community features

## Migration Strategy

To avoid breaking existing users while implementing these improvements:

1. Create a new major version (1.0) with the improvements
2. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
3. Provide migration guide for breaking changes
4. Offer legacy module for old API compatibility
5. Deprecate old patterns gradually with clear warnings

## Success Metrics

- Test coverage > 90%
- Type coverage 100%
- Documentation coverage 100%
- Successful builds on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Package available on PyPI with wheels
- Active community engagement
- Regular release cycle established
